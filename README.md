# A clean, minimalistic react music player web application.

This app is made by Wilson and modified by an2ta for Tats library songs

This project was made by following Dev Ed's react course, with some of my personal tweaks. In the course, he used scss modules to style, while I used styled components. I choose to use styled components because of the advantage of being able to style based on props, which is personally, is much more convenient than add class and scss modules.

## Test it out yourself!

https://wilson-react-music-player.vercel.app/

Clone the repository and start testing out the application yourself!

In the project directory, you can run:

```
// 1. If you have not installed Yarn:
npm install yarn

// 2. Install the dependencies:
yarn install

// 3. Kick start the project in development mode:
yarn start
```

If you're ready to deploy the application to the internet, use:
```
yarn build
```
This will build the app for production to the "build" folder. The Built version will be optimized for best performance.
